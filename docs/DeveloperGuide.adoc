By: `Team CS2113 T13-2`      Since: `Aug 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/t13g2/forum/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete m/CS2113 i/1`.

.Component interactions for `delete m/CS2113 i/1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `ForumBookChangedEvent` when the Forum Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete m/CS2113 i/1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/t13g2/forum/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ModuleListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/t13g2/forum/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/t13g2/forum/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ForumBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete m/CS2113 i/1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete m/CS2113 i/1` Command
image::DeleteThreadSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/t13g2/forum/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Forum Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Thread>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Forum Book`, which `Thread` can reference. This would allow `Forum Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/t13g2/forum/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Forum Book data in object string binary format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `t13g2.forum.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::CURD feature
=== CURD feature
==== Current Implementation
CURD refers to `create`, `update`, `read` and `delete`. This feature is implemented to achieve the basic functionalities of the Forum Book. It extends `ForumBook` with various commands and supports the following operations:

* `createThread`: Create a new thread under a specific module that exists with comment.
* `createComment`: Create a new comment under a specific thread that exists.
* `updateThread`: Update a existing thread title created by its user.
* `updateComment`: Update a existing comment content created by its user.
* `listModule`: List out all the modules in the Forum Book.
* `selectModule`: Select a specific module and list out all the threads under the module.
* `selectThread`: Select a specific thread and list out all the comments under the thread.
* `deleteThread`: Delete a specific thread.
* `deleteComment`: Delete a specific comment.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the CURD can be operated by user at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application, executes `createThread mCode/CS2113 tTitle/Exam Information cContent/What is the topic coverage for the final?` to create and add the thread into storage file. The createThread command calls `UnitOfWork.commit()`, saving the modified forum book state into ForumBookStorage.

Step 2. The user executes `createComment tId/123 cContent/This is a new comment content` to create and add the comment into storage file. The createComment command calls `UnitOfWork.commit()`, saving the modified forum book state into ForumBookStorage.

Step 3. The user executes `updateThread tId/123 tTitle/This is a new thread title` to update the title of the specific thread from storage file. The updateThread command calls `UnitOfWork.getForumThreadRepository().getThread(threadId)`，`forumThread.setTitle()` and lastly `UnitOfWork.commit()`, saving the modified forum book state into ForumBookStorage.

Step 4. The user executes `updateComment cId/123 cContent/This is a new comment content` to update the content of the specific comment from storage file. The updateComment command calls `UnitOfWork.getCommentRepository().getComment(commentId)`，`comment.setContent()` and lastly `UnitOfWork.commit()`, saving the modified forum book state into ForumBookStorage.

Step 5. The user executes `listModule` to retrieve all the existing modules from storage file. The `listModule` command calls `UnitOfWork.getModuleRepository().getAllModule()` which returns the module list to be shown in the panel.

Step 6. The user executes `selectModule mCode/CS2113` to retrieve the module with module code CS2113 and its thread list from storage file. The `selectModule` command calls `UnitOfWork.getModuleRepository().getModuleByCode(moduleCode)` and `UnitOfWork.getForumThreadRepository().getThreadsByModule(module)` to return the module and thread list to be shown in the panel.

Step 7. The user executes `selectThread tId/123` to retrieve the thread with ID 123 and its comments from storage file. The `selectModule` command calls `UnitOfWork.getForumThreadRepository().getThread(threadId)` and `UnitOfWork.getCommentRepository().getCommentsByThread(threadId)` to return the thread and comment list to be shown in the panel.

Step 8. The user executes `deleteThread tId/123` to delete/remove the thread with ID 123 from storage file. The deleteThread command calls `UnitOfWork.getForumThreadRepository().deleteThread(threadId)` and `UnitOfWork.commit()` to save the modified forum book state.

Step 9. The user executes `deleteComment cId/123` to delete/remove the comment with ID 123 from storage file. The deleteComment command calls `UnitOfWork.getCommentRepository().deleteComment(commentId)` and `UnitOfWork.commit()` to save the modified forum book state.

[NOTE]
If the syntax of a command is wrong, the program will prompt the user to try again and show a suggested command format.
//end of CURD feature

=== Storage

==== Design Consideration

As the basis of the whole program, storage should be robust, efficient and stable at all the time.
Data consistency and multi-thread access should be specially taken care of.

==== Overview

ForumBook's storage consists of six(6) parts.

* User
** Stores user information like username, password, email etc.
* Announcement
** Stores announcement set by admin, multiple announcements can be saved in the storage.
* Module
** Stores module information like module name, code etc.
* ForumThread
** Stores threads posted by users
* Comment
** Stores comments under threads
* RunningId
** Used for generating auto incremented ID, each the above entity has a unique ID

These components are stored separately in six files for performance, see below for detailed process of loading and saving.

==== Storage Structure

To avoid unnecessary disk IO, each part of the storage is saved in a file located in `forumData` directory.
All data manipulation must be done within an `IUnitOfWork` where developer has to commit if the data
should be persistent on disk, and rollback if the exception is thrown somewhere during the transaction.

`IStorage` defines interface to access file systems, this handles how our program actually get/read data.
By default, we have `FileStorage` which stores and reads data from local hard disk. More storage options
 can be achieved by implementing this interface. eg: `FtpStorage`

`IForumBookStorage` defines interface to access data entities

`I*Repository` defines interface to how we can manipulate different entities.
Each entity is managed by a repository, eg: `IUserRepository`

`*Storage` is a thin wrapper for the ease of serializing data into `ObjectStream`

Data are saved in ObjectStream

`RunningId` does not work as the other entities do, it has its own logic to make sure IDs are consistent among processes
if the user runs more than one instance of the program.

=== User management

==== Current Implementation
The user management is facilitated by various commands. It extends `ForumBook` with a user management tool. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `AddUserCommand` -- Add user to forum book.

* `LoginCommand`: login to forum book.

* `LogoutCommand`: logout from the forum book.

* `UpdateCommand`: Update a certain user's password, email and/or phone.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the user management behaves at each step.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- +
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the user management can be operated by user at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `addUser uName/UserName uPass/password` to add a new user into forum userStorage file. The addUser command calls 'unitOfWork.getUserRepository().getUserByUsername(userToAdd.getUsername())' to check if the name entered by the user is available. If there is not duplicate, User can be registered. If the registration is successful, addUser command calls `UnitOfWork.commit()` to save the modified forum book state into UserStorage.

Step 2. The user executes `login uName/UserName uPass/password` to login to the forum. The login command calls 'unitOfWork.getUserRepository().authenticate(userName, userPassword)' to check if the login can be authorise. If success, login command calls `Context.getInstance().setCurrentUser(exist)` to create an instance for the authorised user.

Step 3. The user executes `logout` to exit the forum or to switch user, logout command calls 'EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new UserLoginEvent("", false, false))' to close the instance created by the user. Next/ another user is able to login after a successful logout.

ToDo:
Step 4. The user executes `updateUserComment ` to update the uPass.
// tag::dataencryption[]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- +

=== Admin management

==== Current Implementation
The admin management is facilitated by various commands. It extends `ForumBook` with a admin management tool. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `AnnounceCommand` -- Posts new announcement.

* `CheckAnnouncementCommand`: Checks for latest announcement.

* `BlockUserFromCreatingCommand`: Blocks a user from posting either new threads or comments.

* `SetAdminCommand`: Sets a user as admin or reverts an admin to user.

* `CreateModuleCommand`: Creates a module by admin.

* `DeleteModuleCommand`: Deletes a specific module by admin.

* `AdminUpdatePasswordCommand`: Updates a certain user's password by admin.

* `DeleteUserCommand`: Deletes a certain user by admin.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the admin management behaves at each step.


Step 1. The admin launches the application, executes `announce aTitle/Urgent! aContent/System maintenance from 3PM to 6PM.` to add the announcement to storage file. The `announce` command calls `UnitOfWork.getAnnouncementRepository.addAnnouncement(announcement)` and then `UnitOfWork.commit()`, causing a modified forum book state to be saved into `ForumBookStorage`

image::SDAnnounce.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The admin/user executes `checkAnnounce` to check for the latest announcement in storage file. The `checkAnnounce` calls the `UnitOfWork.getAnnouncementRepository().getLatestAnnouncement()` which returns an announcement to be shown in the message dialog.

image::SDCheckAnnounce.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The admin executes `block uName/john` to block john from creating new threads or comments. The `block` calls `User.setIsBlock(true)` and then `UnitOfWork.commit()`, causing another modified forum book state to be saved into `ForumBookStorage`.

image::SDBlockUserFromCreating.png[width="800"]

Step 4. The admin executes `setAdmin uName/john set/true` to set a certain user as admin or to revert an admin to user. The `setAdmin` calls the `User.setAdmin(true)` and then `UnitOfWork.commit()`, causing another modified forum book state to be saved into `ForumBookStorage`.

image::SDSetAdmin.png[width="800"]

Step 5. The admin executes `createModule mCode/CS2113 mTitle/Software Engineering and OOP` to create the specific module. The `createModule` calls the `UnitOfWork.getModuleRepository().addModule(module)` and then `UnitOfWork.commit()`, causing another modified forum book state to be save into `ForumBookStorage`.

image::SDCreateModule.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The admin executes `deleteModule mCode/CS2113` to delete specific module. The `deleteModule` calls the `UnitOfWork.getModuleRepository().removeModule(module);` and then `UnitOfWork.commit()`, causing another modified forum book state to be save into `ForumBookStorage`.

image::SDDeleteModule.png[width="800"]

Step 7. The admin executes `updatePass uName/john uPass/098` to update the user john's password. The `updatePass` calls the `UnitOfWork.getUserRepository().updateUser(user)` and then `UnitOfWork.commit()`, causing another modified forum book state to be save into `ForumBookStorage`.

image::SDUpdatePass.png[width="800"]

Step 8. The admin executes `deleteUser uName/john` to delete the user john. The `deleteUser` calls the ` UnitOfWork.getUserRepository().deleteUser(userToDelete)` and then `UnitOfWork.commit()`, causing another modified forum book state to be save into `ForumBookStorage`.

image::SDDeleteUser.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the syntax of a command is wrong, the program will prompt the user to try again and show a suggested command format.

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== Data Encryption

Data encryption is done in a transparent layer between `ForumBookStorage` and `FileStorage`.

All data using in this app is encrypted.

A very simple, naive, and insecure encryption is implemented, this is only for demoing the ability of
encrypting data in this app. However, a more secure algorithm can be easily added in to the app by
implementing the `IEncryptor` interface and provide it into `IStorage`.

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_


|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===

One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `t13g2.forum.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `t13g2.forum.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
