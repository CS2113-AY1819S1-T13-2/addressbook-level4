== Introduction

ForumBook (FB) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for module ForumBook*. More importantly, FB is optimized for those who *prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, FB can be a great place to learn and share comments regarding modules offered in NUS.This can be done faster than traditional GUI apps. Can't wait? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
