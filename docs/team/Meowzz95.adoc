== PROJECT: ForumBook

---

== Overview

ForumBook is a desktop forum application which allows students to exchange information of the courses offered by their school. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in OOP fashion.

== Summary of contributions

* *Code contributed*: [https://nuscs2113-ay1819s1.github.io/dashboard/#=undefined&search=meowzz95[Functional code]]

* *Main feature implemented:*: A underlying storage system that powers the application and manager
classes that provide APIs for other developers to manipulate application database in a robust way.
** What it does: Takes care of data storage, data encryption, and provide APIs for accessing the data.
*** `IStorage`: A interface that defines a storage that handles read/write to storage device/service
*** `IEncryptor`: A interface that defines a encryptor who knows an algorithm to encrypt/decrypt data
*** `SimpleEncryptor`: A concrete implementation of `IEncryptor`, it uses a simple and insecure 'OR' encryption for demoing the ability of data encryption in this application
*** `JsonFileStorage`: A concrete implementation of `IStorage`, it takes an `IEntryptor`(or by default it uses `SimpleEncryptor`) and use it to write encrypted json data to hard disk / read encrypted json data from hard disk
*** `BaseEntityStorage`: A base class for all types of entity storage, it uses generics to define the underlying `List` and a flag to keep track of whether this storage has been modified.
*** `[Entity]Storage`: Storage classes who extend `BaseEntityStorage` eg: `UserStorage`
*** `RunningId`: Singleton that handles Id generating, this mimics an auto-increment primary key field in a relational database, but a much simplified implementation.
*** `StorageMapping`: Singleton that maps class to file path, avoid magic numbers(strings).
*** `IForumBookStorage`: A interface, it defines a manager class that controls the loading/committing/accessing of data.
*** `I[Entity]Repository`: Entity repository interfaces that define the APIs of manipulating application data
*** `[Entity]Repository`: Concrete implementations of `I[Entity]Repository`
*** `IUnitOfWork`: A interface, it defines a wrapper that groups one or more operations into a single transaction, ensure data consistency
*** `UnitOfWork`: A concrete implementation of `IUnitOfWork`
*** `SampleDataGenerator`: A helper class to generate sample data after a fresh copy of this application is started


** Justification: This structure enables the application to manage multiple entities in a robust way.
** Highlights: This design takes data consistency and potential future storage possibilities(eg:store everything in a server) into account. Unit of work pattern ensures that even if one of a series of operation fails, the whole set of operation will not be saved, our data is always in a good shape.


* *Minor feature implemented*: Added a `Context` class that manages user login status and provide API for other commands to check login status.
